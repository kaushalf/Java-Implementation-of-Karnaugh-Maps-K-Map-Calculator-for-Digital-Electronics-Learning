Digital Electronics is a fundamental subject in the field of electrical engineering, focusing on the study of digital circuits and systems. One of the essential topics covered in this subject is the Karnaugh Map (K-Map), a graphical method used for simplifying Boolean algebra expressions and optimizing logic circuits. To enhance the learning experience for students in the third semester, I undertook the project of implementing a K-Map calculator in Java.

# Overview of the Project:

The project aims to provide students with a hands-on tool for better understanding Karnaugh Maps and their application in digital circuit design. The implemented calculator supports K-Maps of various dimensions, including 2-variable, 3-variable, and 4-variable maps. The tool facilitates the simplification of Boolean expressions by visually representing the truth table in a K-Map and identifying optimal groupings of adjacent cells.

**Implementation Details:**

The K-Map calculator is built using Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language. The calculator incorporates a user-friendly interface, allowing students to input truth table values for their digital circuits easily. The implementation involves the use of nested loops to navigate through the K-Map cells and identify adjacent cells for grouping.

**Key Features:**

Variable Support: The calculator supports 2-variable, 3-variable, and 4-variable Karnaugh Maps, catering to the varying complexity of digital circuits.
User-friendly Interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) provides an intuitive platform for students to input truth table values and visualize the K-Map.
Optimization: The calculator identifies and highlights optimal groupings in the K-Map, aiding students in simplifying Boolean expressions efficiently.
# Logic Building: With the implementation of over 1000 nested loops, the calculator demonstrates advanced logic building techniques, showcasing the power and flexibility of Java in handling intricate digital circuit scenarios.
